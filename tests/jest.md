# Jest

Jest is a very comprehensive testing suite that also includes test runner,
assertion and coverage concerns included. This results in minimal configuration
required, and for a react project requires no configuration at all. Easy to get
started.

Some important features are:
1. Considers contents of `__tests__` folder or any `.test.js` and `.spec.js`
files as test files
2. Uses familiar syntax like describe, test, expect, toBe, toEqual  and [almost
every method](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html#methods)
3. Has features to test async code using `done`
4. Setup and teardown to add reusable test code
5. Has inbuilt mocking method `jest.fn().mock`
